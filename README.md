### navs

Navigation is done by using the html element <code> nav </code>.

Add a class of nav to the nav element. There are some optional classes on nav elements such as

- nav-pills : Which makes navs look like buttons.

- nav-fill: all nav-items will have equal length

- nav-justified: all nav-items will have equal spacing.  

- flex-column: this is  a great class for mobile experience, but the problem is it will have on all devices the mobile experience. so, you need to use <code> flex-ALN-row </code>  where ALN can be <code> center </code>,  <code> end </code> or <code> start </code>.

- justified-content-ALN, this move navs horizontally like in layout where you can move rows.


Moreover, children items inside <code> nav </code> element are the anchor tags.
